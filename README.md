# Action Maps

A dynamic action mapping system for Bevy.

## Why Action Maps?

Action maps provides an interface similar to Unity's InputSystem and Godot's
Input Map. With Action Maps, you can assign functionality to any available Bevy
input item without having to work directly with they inputs themselves. 

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    todo!();
}
```
